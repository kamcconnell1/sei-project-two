## Get-a-Gif

A fun React App which pulls from the Giphy API and allows users to search for a Gif with key words, see the latest trending Gifs, save to favourites or copy to clipboard. 


### Brief

A pair coded project built within two days. The app had to: 

* Consume a public API - Giphy
* Have several components
* Include wireframes
* Be deployed online - Netlify

### Technologies Used 
* JavaScript
* React
* CSS
* SASS
* Axios

### Approach Taken 
We wanted to create a fun app that served a purpose.........

### Screenshot Walk-Through

#### HomePage


#### Trending Page 


#### Favourites Page 


#### Error Page if no Favourites Added 


#### Mobile View 



### Functionality 

The app allows users to 
* Search for a Gif based on keywords put in
* See the top 20 latest trending Gifs on Giphy
* Add Gifs to favourites, saved in local storage 
* Copy a Gif link to the clipboard 


### Process

Once we agreed on using the Giphy API our wireframe came along quite quickly which we successfully stuck to throughout the project & used to keep in mind which aspects we thought were necessary and which were nice to haves. 

#### Miro Wireframe 


We spent the first afternoon choosing the API, producing the wireframe for our app and trying out the different API endpoints using Insomnia. 

The second morning was spent setting up the app in React and ensuring we could get the API requests to show using axios. By the end of the first day we had all the app pages and routes set up and the API calls working aswell as the majority of the styling done using SASS and Bulma. 

On the day of submission we spent time refactoring our code, adding extras like toasts, loading spinners and lazy loading.

### Wins and Blockers 

One of the biggest blockers we had was working with some of the React Components we installed which came with minimal documentation. .....

Bulma saves a lot of tiem on the grid pages but can also make styling the extras a lot longer 

Huge win was producing all the pages we wanted in our wire frame in the time proviced 


### Future Features 


### Key Learnings

Working solo for this project was both a curse and a blessing. Whilst it was a blessing in the sense I had a complete overview of everything the app did and how it worked, testing my knowledge to the limits, it did prove challenging when it came to issues as there was fewer people to assist. I found tasks took a lot longer than they did in the group projects, so I had to make sure I was prioritising my workload effectively. It meant I had to scale back my ambitions occasionally to allow me to reach the deadlines on time. I'm really pleased that I solved a problem in the real world, so this is definitely something I want to pursue more in my side projects going forward. This will require a lot more time spent when map and coordinate APIs, which can be quite challenging at times.
